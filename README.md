### Carthage git submodule POC

This repo uses two repo's from Github:

 * [Mast](https://github.com/Mast-Swift/Mast) 
 * [Mast-HBar](https://github.com/Mast-Swift/Mast-HBar.git) 

to see whether Carthage will recursively download Git submodules within those repo's.

This repo is related to [Carthage-847](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/847) in that I was curious whether I'd see the same problem or not.
